The purpose of this is to allow framing the question in terms of the DH construct, which is generally more familiar to members of the OT-cyber community. It also allows experimenting with tools we have at hand without needing to modify existing libraries such as OpenSSL. Second, I present lessons from experiments with TLS found in the existing literature, as applicable to the DNP3-SAv6 and IEC 62351-5 protocols. Finally, I present proposed changes to DNP3-SAv6, as presented to the DNP CSTF at the time of this writing, with their background reasoning."

In the case of a DH, this happens by Alice and Bob exchanging their respective public keys, and each using their respective private keys and each others' public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "While that use case is similar, there are significant differences: KEM does not provide mutual authentication where DH does, which means KEM requires the use of a separate digital signature algorithm: DH also requires the use of a signature algorithm, but only during public key exchanges while KEM requires it every time a new shared key is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to KEM, DH does not allow its user any influence over the contents of the symmetric key. Also, because with the use of the same keys the resulting shared secret is always the same, it is recommended to always include a salting step (generally in the form of a publicly-communicated salt and an HKDF function).

    "\n",
    "Because there are only two functions, and the exchange function $X$ is symmetrical (in that $X~sk_a~pk_b = X~sk_b~pk_a$), generation of the shared secret can be done without any on-line communication, provided the foreign public key $fpk$ is known, and if the public key $pk$ is trusted by the recipient of a message, no further signatures are necessary. This means that if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and she wants to use a unique symmetric key to encrypt it (say using an AEAD), she only has to send the ciphertext of her message and the salt used to generate the symmetric key $\\langle m', salt\\rangle$ to Bob. With KEM, the equivalent would be to generate a a shared secret and corresponding ciphertext, and send both the ciphertext and the salt along with the message to Bob, signing the entire message with a separate private key so Bob can verify the message, sending $\\langle m, ct, signature\\rangle$."

While that \"ciphertext\" has no real relation to the shared secret, it can be used to re-generate the same shared secret when using the original, non-ephemeral private key.\n",

    "2. TLS is extensible in that extensions are explicitly allowed on the `ClientHello` and `ServerHello` messages, and TLS 1.3 was designed with the goal of reducing the number of round trips needed to establish and authenticate a session, but that requires the client to send its KEM public key in the `ClientHello` message. This puts a constraint on how PQC can be implemented in TLS without breaking backward comparibility.\n",
    "3. A hybrid approach, mixing classical cryptography that can still be trusted (even when $Q$-time has expired) with PQC being used to back up the classical cryptography, but only insofar as the PQC can be trusted in the long term, and the classical cryptography can be trusted now. That is: if the PQC turns out to be unreliable cryptographically, the only risk the communication is exposed to is the \"harvest now, decrypt later\" attack vector.\n",

It replaces DNP3-SAv5, which was specified in <cite data-cite=\"6327578\">IEEE Std 1815-2012</cite>, and addresses concerns and weaknesses identified by J. Adam Crain and Sergey Bratus in <cite data-cite=\"crain2015bolt\">\"Bolt-on security extensions for industrial control system protocols: A case study of DNP3 SAv5\", IEEE Security & Privacy, 2015</cite> and by the DNP Technical Committee in <cite data-cote=\"dnptb2016002\">DNP3 Technical Bulletin TB2016-002 Addressing Deficiencies in DNP3-SAv5</cite>. At the time of this writimg, the specification for DNP3 that incorporates SAv6 has not yet been published. DNP3-SAv6 and IEC 62351-5<cite data-cite=\"iec62351.5.2023\"></cite> were co-developed and share large parts of their design.\n",

    "### Current use of ECDH in DNP3-SAv6\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to TLS and similar protocols, DNP3-SAv6 does not allow for ciphersuite negotiation: in DNP3-SAv6 the master and outstation are generally expected to be pre-configured to support a certain set of algorithms, and the master dictates which ones will be used. As the master is the party in the association that starts the association (potentially at the request of the outstation) it is equivalent, in TLS parlance, to the client. This is essentially equivalent to the client always dictating which ciphersuite shall be used for a given association, while the server can only either accept the dictate or refuse the association, according to system policy and local implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this limits some of the flexibility of the protocol, it also resolves one of the design questions raised by <cite data-cite=\"cryptoeprint:2019/858\">E. Crockett et al.</cite>: if any hybrid algorithms are to be used, they must be a well-defined hybrid that can be unambiguously identified by both the master and the outstation using only information provided in the `AssociationRequest` and `AssociationResponse` messages. This constraint also avoids the \"combinatorial explosion\" TLS 1.2 approaches may suffer from<cite data-cite=\"cryptoeprint:2019/858\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DNP3-SAv6, the master station (a.k.a. controlling station in IEC 62351-5<cite data-cite=\"iec62351.5.2023\"></cite>) sends its certificates, including its ECDH public key, to the outstation (a.k.a. controlled station) in a message called the `AssociationRequest`. The outstation responds with its own certificate, including its ECDH public key, in an `AssociationResponse`. Both sides then calculate the Encryption and Authentication Update Keys and prove to each other that they have the same keys, using the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` and `UpdateKeyChangeResponse` messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Update Keys are established, only symmetric cryptography is used for authentication and encryption: MACs are used to prove ownership of the Update Keys and to authenticate the handshake transcript, AES is used in the keywrap algorithm (KWA) to establish session keys, and an AEAD is used for authenticated encryption during the sessions. All symmetric keys are at least 256 bitsin size, which even in light of Grover's algorithm<cite data-cite=\"grover1996fast\"></cite> is sufficient in this contect. Therefore, only the association handshake is affected by PQC considerations."

    "### Introducing a KEM into the association handshake\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing this ECDH-based mechanism with a KEM-based mechanism would either have the master send its certificates and KEM public key to the outstation in the `AssociationRequest` message, and have the outstation send its certificates and the $ct$ value in the `AssociationResponse` message, or would have the master indicate its intent to use a KEM in the `AssociationRequest` message using an as-yet-to-be-defined object, have the outstation respond with the KEM public key in the `AssociationResponse` message, and have the master send the $ct$ in the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message. The choice of which party provides the public key and which party provides the $ct$ depends on the relative cost of the key encapsulation and decapsulation functions, discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach, which places key encapsulation on the outstation but gives the choice of the algorithm to use to the master, can be implemented without making any changes to the specified formats of any of the four messages in the handshake: both the `AssociationRequest` and the `AssociationResponse` message have a reserved space for certificate data for which the specification is flexible enough to allow for the addition of PQC cryptographic materials in the payload. As discussed below, this space may not be large enough to accomodate the change, which can be specified in a DNP Technical Bulletin after the standard's publication if needed. In this case, no new SPDU types and no changes in the SA version field value would be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the data field *is* currently under-specified: the format borrows from RFC 8446 and refers to section 4.4.2 of that specification, but that format is not sufficiently extensible for our purpose and does not allow explicitly signing the ECDH public key, which means ownership of each party's private keys may never be proven and which moves a possible failure due to tampering to the end of the handshake. (This may be a performance issue and, in some cases, a security issue, as was reported to the CSTF on July 28, 2023.) DNP3-SAv6 also calls for an optional use of an OCSP response for OCSP stapling, which is defined as an extension in TLS. The total size of the TLS construct can reach $2^{24}-1+2^8-1$ octets, which exceeds the $2^{16}-1$ octets allocated in DNP3-SAv6<cite data-cite=\"ieee1815.202x\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach would require the addition of an as-yet-to-be-defined object in the `AssociationRequest` for the master to indicate a KEM should be used. This is something that cannot currently be accomodated with the specified `AssociationRequest` syntax. It also requires the master to convey the KEM ciphertext to the outstation in the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message, which would be a change of format for that message. If this change were introduced after publication of the new standard incorporating SAv6, this would mean either the addition of a new SPDU (Security Protocol Data Unit) type or a change in SA version.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pre-publication version of this paper was discussed at the Wednesday, July 19, 2023 meeting of the DNP Cybersecurity Task Force (CSTF) where it was decided to add a field to the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message allowing the master to convey a KEM ciphertext to the outstation, thus allowing to switch the burden of calculating the ciphertext from the outstation to the master. Subsequent discusiion on the CSTF mailing list leaves the possibility for additional changes open, however."

    "### Size considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three size-related considerations that need to be taken into account when considering cryptography in the context of DNP3 and, more generally, OT, IoT, and IIoT systems: the amount of bits-on-the-wire data needed to transfer cryptographic data, the amount of on-device non-volatile memory needed to store cryptographic data, and the amount of run-time memory needed to process cryptographic data and cryptographic functions. M. Kumar's survey in <cite data-cite=\"kumar2022post\">\"Post-quantum cryptography Algorithm's standardization and performance analysis\"</cite> includes statistics on the maximum stack and heap usage on a representative device with a number of different algorithms, showing a wide range of values, only some of which are concerning in terms of memory usage in small devices. The choice of algorithms in an OT system can likely fairly easily avoid those more concerning algorithms in favor of less resource-hungry ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general guideline in the design of DNP3 cybersecurity is to limit the need for non-volatile storage aa much as possible, and to restrict the use of such storage to read-only use during normal operation except for the potential storage of the association's Update Keys, which are intended to be long-lived. The general idea being that a device only need to be able to present its \"birth certificate\", which may be self-signed and a counter-signed version of which may be provisioned to the master by the system's DNP Authority. Outside of that birth certificate, which can be generated at the device's first boot-up in factory, only 64 bytes of writable non-volatile storage are needed by DNP3-SAv6, as that is the size of the two Update Keys combined<cite data-cite=\"ieee1815.202x\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important size consideration, then, is the a,ount of bits-on-the-wire bandwidth needed to set up an association. This will typically only happen once in the drvice's life-time and once the association is set up only symmetric cryptography is used for any session in that association. The asymmetric-cryptography-related cryptographic material that needs to be transferred consists of X.509 certificates, data needed for key exchange or key encapsulation, and digital aignatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this writing, the total size of both master and outstation certificate data is limited, in both the `AssociationRequest` and the `AssociationResponse` message, to 65,535 bytes. This precludes the use of some PQC algorithms, for which the size of a single public key can exceed 319 kiB and go up to 1.4 MiB for NTS-KEM using certain parameters, for example<cite data-cite=\"albrecht2019nts\"></cite>. This issue can be remediated by adding a third octet to the size fields in those two messages, an option that is currently under discussion with the DNP CSTF. Care will still need to be taken to make sure an association handshake does not interfere with the operational communication requirements of other devices on the same network <cite data-cite=\"tibodeau2023cstf\">(ref. [a comment to this effect on the CSTF mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/dnp3sav6/c/-YzYlZutBBM/m/T5hjM8d9AAAJ))</cite>.\n",
