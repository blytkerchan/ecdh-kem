The purpose of this is to allow framing the question in terms of the DH construct, which is generally more familiar to members of the OT-cyber community. It also allows experimenting with tools we have at hand without needing to modify existing libraries such as OpenSSL. Second, I present lessons from experiments with TLS found in the existing literature, as applicable to the DNP3-SAv6 and IEC 62351-5 protocols. Finally, I present proposed changes to DNP3-SAv6, as presented to the DNP CSTF at the time of this writing, with their background reasoning."

In the case of a DH, this happens by Alice and Bob exchanging their respective public keys, and each using their respective private keys and each others' public keys.\n",

    "\n",
    "Similarly to KEM, DH does not allow its user any influence over the contents of the symmetric key. Also, because with the use of the same keys the resulting shared secret is always the same, it is recommended to always include a salting step (generally in the form of a publicly-communicated salt and an HKDF function).

    "Because there are only two functions, and the exchange function $X$ is symmetrical (in that $X~sk_a~pk_b = X~sk_b~pk_a$), generation of the shared secret can be done without any on-line communication, provided the foreign public key $fpk$ is known, and if the public key $pk$ is trusted by the recipient of a message, no further signatures are necessary. This means that if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and she wants to use a unique symmetric key to encrypt it (say using an AEAD), she only has to send the ciphertext of her message and the salt used to generate the symmetric key $\\langle m', salt\\rangle$ to Bob. With KEM, the equivalent would be to generate a a shared secret and corresponding ciphertext, and send both the ciphertext and the salt along with the message to Bob, signing the entire message with a separate private key so Bob can verify the message, sending $\\langle m, ct, signature\\rangle$."

    "2. TLS is extensible in that extensions are explicitly allowed on the `ClientHello` and `ServerHello` messages, and TLS 1.3 was designed with the goal of reducing the number of round trips needed to establish and authenticate a session, but that requires the client to send its KEM public key in the `ClientHello` message. This puts a constraint on how PQC can be implemented in TLS without breaking backward comparibility.\n",
    "3. A hybrid approach, mixing classical cryptography that can still be trusted (even when $Q$-time has expired) with PQC being used to back up the classical cryptography, but only insofar as the PQC can be trusted in the long term, and the classical cryptography can be trusted now. That is: if the PQC turns out to be unreliable cryptographically, the only risk the communication is exposed to is the \"harvest now, decrypt later\" attack vector.\n",

It replaces DNP3-SAv5, which was specified in <cite data-cite=\"6327578\">IEEE Std 1815-2012</cite>, and addresses concerns and weaknesses identified by J. Adam Crain and Sergey Bratus in <cite data-cite=\"crain2015bolt\">\"Bolt-on security extensions for industrial control system protocols: A case study of DNP3 SAv5\", IEEE Security & Privacy, 2015</cite> and by the DNP Technical Committee in <cite data-cote=\"dnptb2016002\">DNP3 Technical Bulletin TB2016-002 Addressing Deficiencies in DNP3-SAv5</cite>. At the time of this writimg, the specification for DNP3 that incorporates SAv6 has not yet been published. DNP3-SAv6 and IEC 62351-5<cite data-cite=\"iec62351.5.2023\"></cite> were co-developed and share large parts of their design.\n",

    "### Current use of ECDH in DNP3-SAv6\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to TLS and similar protocols, DNP3-SAv6 does not allow for ciphersuite negotiation: in DNP3-SAv6 the master and outstation are generally expected to be pre-configured to support a certain set of algorithms, and the master dictates which ones will be used. As the master is the party in the association that starts the association (potentially at the request of the outstation) it is equivalent, in TLS parlance, to the client. This is essentially equivalent to the client always dictating which ciphersuite shall be used for a given association, while the server can only either accept the dictate or refuse the association, according to system policy and local implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this limits some of the flexibility of the protocol, it also resolves one of the design questions raised by <cite data-cite=\"cryptoeprint:2019/858\">E. Crockett et al.</cite>: if any hybrid algorithms are to be used, they must be a well-defined hybrid that can be unambiguously identified by both the master and the outstation using only information provided in the `AssociationRequest` and `AssociationResponse` messages. This constraint also avoids the \"combinatorial explosion\" TLS 1.2 approaches may suffer from<cite data-cite=\"cryptoeprint:2019/858\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DNP3-SAv6, the master station (a.k.a. controlling station in IEC 62351-5<cite data-cite=\"iec62351.5.2023\"></cite>) sends its certificates, including its ECDH public key, to the outstation (a.k.a. controlled station) in a message called the `AssociationRequest`. The outstation responds with its own certificate, including its ECDH public key, in an `AssociationResponse`. Both sides then calculate the Encryption and Authentication Update Keys and prove to each other that they have the same keys, using the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` and `UpdateKeyChangeResponse` messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Update Keys are established, only symmetric cryptography is used for authentication and encryption: MACs are used to prove ownership of the Update Keys and to authenticate the handshake transcript, AES is used in the keywrap algorithm (KWA) to establish session keys, and an AEAD is used for authenticated encryption during the sessions. All symmetric keys are at least 256 bitsin size, which even in light of Grover's algorithm<cite data-cite=\"grover1996fast\"></cite> is sufficient in this contect. Therefore, only the association handshake is affected by PQC considerations."

    "Replacing this ECDH-based mechanism with a KEM-based mechanism would either have the master send its certificates and KEM public key to the outstation in the `AssociationRequest` message, and have the outstation send its certificates and the $ct$ value in the `AssociationResponse` message, or would have the master indicate its intent to use a KEM in the `AssociationRequest` message using an as-yet-to-be-defined object, have the outstation respond with the KEM public key in the `AssociationResponse` message, and have the master send the $ct$ in the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message. The choice of which party provides the public key and which party provides the $ct$ depends on the relative cost of the key encapsulation and decapsulation functions, discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach, which places key encapsulation on the outstation but gives the choice of the algorithm to use to the master, can be implemented without making any changes to the specified formats of any of the four messages in the handshake: both the `AssociationRequest` and the `AssociationResponse` message have a reserved space for certificate data for which the specification is flexible enough to allow for the addition of PQC cryptographic materials in the payload. As discussed below, this space may not be large enough to accomodate the change, which can be specified in a DNP Technical Bulletin after the standard's publication if needed. In this case, no new SPDU types and no changes in the SA version field value would be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the data field *is* currently under-specified: the format borrows from RFC 8446 and refers to section 4.4.2 of that specification, but that format is not sufficiently extensible for our purpose and does not allow explicitly signing the ECDH public key, which means ownership of each party's private keys may never be proven and which moves a possible failure due to tampering to the end of the handshake. (This may be a performance issue and, in some cases, a security issue, as was reported to the CSTF on July 28, 2023.) DNP3-SAv6 also calls for an optional use of an OCSP response for OCSP stapling, which is defined as an extension in TLS. The total size of the TLS construct can reach $2^{24}-1+2^8-1$ octets, which exceeds the $2^{16}-1$ octets allocated in DNP3-SAv6<cite data-cite=\"ieee1815.202x\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach would require the addition of an as-yet-to-be-defined object in the `AssociationRequest` for the master to indicate a KEM should be used. This is something that cannot currently be accomodated with the specified `AssociationRequest` syntax. It also requires the master to convey the KEM ciphertext to the outstation in the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message, which would be a change of format for that message. If this change were introduced after publication of the new standard incorporating SAv6, this would mean either the addition of a new SPDU (Security Protocol Data Unit) type or a change in SA version.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pre-publication version of this paper was discussed at the Wednesday, July 19, 2023 meeting of the DNP Cybersecurity Task Force (CSTF) where it was decided to add a field to the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message allowing the master to convey a KEM ciphertext to the outstation, thus allowing to switch the burden of calculating the ciphertext from the outstation to the master. Subsequent discusiion on the CSTF mailing list leaves the possibility for additional changes open, however."

    "### Size considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three size-related considerations that need to be taken into account when considering cryptography in the context of DNP3 and, more generally, OT, IoT, and IIoT systems: the amount of bits-on-the-wire data needed to transfer cryptographic data, the amount of on-device non-volatile memory needed to store cryptographic data, and the amount of run-time memory needed to process cryptographic data and cryptographic functions. M. Kumar's survey in <cite data-cite=\"kumar2022post\">\"Post-quantum cryptography Algorithm's standardization and performance analysis\"</cite> includes statistics on the maximum stack and heap usage on a representative device with a number of different algorithms, showing a wide range of values, only some of which are concerning in terms of memory usage in small devices. The choice of algorithms in an OT system can likely fairly easily avoid those more concerning algorithms in favor of less resource-hungry ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general guideline in the design of DNP3 cybersecurity is to limit the need for non-volatile storage aa much as possible, and to restrict the use of such storage to read-only use during normal operation except for the potential storage of the association's Update Keys, which are intended to be long-lived. The general idea being that a device only need to be able to present its \"birth certificate\", which may be self-signed and a counter-signed version of which may be provisioned to the master by the system's DNP Authority. Outside of that birth certificate, which can be generated at the device's first boot-up in factory, only 64 bytes of writable non-volatile storage are needed by DNP3-SAv6, as that is the size of the two Update Keys combined<cite data-cite=\"ieee1815.202x\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important size consideration, then, is the a,ount of bits-on-the-wire bandwidth needed to set up an association. This will typically only happen once in the drvice's life-time and once the association is set up only symmetric cryptography is used for any session in that association. The asymmetric-cryptography-related cryptographic material that needs to be transferred consists of X.509 certificates, data needed for key exchange or key encapsulation, and digital aignatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this writing, the total size of both master and outstation certificate data is limited, in both the `AssociationRequest` and the `AssociationResponse` message, to 65,535 bytes. This precludes the use of some PQC algorithms, for which the size of a single public key can exceed 319 kiB and go up to 1.4 MiB for NTS-KEM using certain parameters, for example<cite data-cite=\"albrecht2019nts\"></cite>. This issue can be remediated by adding a third octet to the size fields in those two messages, an option that is currently under discussion with the DNP CSTF. Care will still need to be taken to make sure an association handshake does not interfere with the operational communication requirements of other devices on the same network <cite data-cite=\"tibodeau2023cstf\">(ref. [a comment to this effect on the CSTF mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/dnp3sav6/c/-YzYlZutBBM/m/T5hjM8d9AAAJ))</cite>.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Computational cost considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Manufacturing cost is always a significant factor when designing and developing OT, IoT, and IIoT devices, especially when those devices are intended to be high-volume and low-cost, and their ability for local processing and communications is seen as secondary-at-best to their primary function of protecting and automating critical infrastructure such as the power system. These considerations weigh heavily in many discussions around how cybersecurity is best designed into protocols such as DNP3. While recent development of ARM CPUs has meant concerns around processing power have become less of an issue for these systems, this \"free\" processing power has also lead to the use of Linux-based operating systems that are often not as optimized for domain-specific applications as had been the case for earlier generations of devices. Such optimization existed mostly out of necessity whereas, today, it represents a cost that can no longer be justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect of these types of systems, which is in part due to the way critical infrastructure development is financed in many countries. is that the devices that make up these systems are typically installed in the field and not replaced for a decade or more. This means that while it is possible to rely on firmware and software upgrades to improve security it is typically not possible to rely on improvements in hardware. Combining that with the fact that many of these devices have much of their computational resources already allocated to the device's primary function and that communications and cybersecurity are often treated as an after-thought the available resources for cyber-related computation can be extremely limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part due to these considerations, DNP3-SAv6 relies heavily on symmetric cryptography, for which hardware acceleration is ubiquitously available and which remains secure in the presence of adversaries with quantum computers. This again constrains the use of a PQC to the Association handshake and may partly drive the choice of both the algorithms to use and on which device (the master or the outstation) key encapsulation takes place. While M. Kumar's survey of post-quantum peformance in <cite data-cite=\"kumar2022post\">\"Post-quantum cryptography Algorithm's standardization and performance analysis\", Array 15, 2022</cite> shows, perhaps surprisingly (at least to me) encapsulating keys can be significantly less costly than decapsulating them, in which case it would make sense to perform encapsulating on the outstation, it may be too early to tell whether that will be true for all KEM standards, so it would be advisable to leave the door open to performing encapsulation on the master when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it should be noted that, as DNP3-SAv6 supports both mutual authentication and data encryption and, once the association is established, does not require asymmetric cryptography for subsequent sessions that nevertheless retain both mutual authentication and data encryption, the additional overhead a TLS connection would require for its sessions (which have their own asymmetric cryptography for every session) becomes unnecessary. I therefore see no reason to recommend using TLS in conjunction with DNP3, and in some cases would actually recommend against it, especially when communicating with resource-constrained devices that are part of critical infrastructure."

    "Cryptanalysis takes time. For the next decade or so, we will be in an inter-regnum of sorts before classical cryptography is no longer safe, but while post-quantum cryptographic standard algorithms have not yet been sufficiently analysed yet to know whether they are safe or not. Hopefully, there will be some overlap between the time safe post-quantum cryptographic standards are widely available, and the time quantum computers that can break classical cryptography are widely available. In the mean time, for some systems for which cybersecurity is sufficiently critical, it will make sense to use both classical and post-quantum cryptography, one in combination with the other.\n",

Where key exchanges and key encapsulations are concerned, this means that the symmetric key used as a result of key negotiation should be a combination of the result of the classical and post-quantum algorithms used such that even if either one (but not both) of the keys is compromised, the key resulting from the combination is still secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly common practice to use a key derivation function for which all but one inputs are public, and use the derived key for encryption.

A similar approach can be used combining the output of a DH and a KEM, especially if the DH has been previously used to model a KEM, as shown in this paper.\n",

    "There will, for some time, be systems in which either the master or the outstation will be capable of using PQC while the other station does not have that capability yet. This may require some new, optional extensions in some of the messages exchanged between master and outstation, which will for now be left to future discussion."

    "\n",
    "To prepare for the addition of PQC to DNP3-SAv6, and to avoid having to develop a DNP3-SAv7 in the near future, some changes to the protocol as currently specified are needed. The recommendations below are intended to (a) leave the door open for some design and implementation choices for which we currently lack sufficient information to be made later, and (b) correct minor issues and future-proof the protocol.\n",

    "Use ASN.1 for `AssociationRequest` and `AssociationResponse` message payloads:\n",
    "\n",
    ": using RFC 8446 notation for the `certificate data` field, while allowing implementations to re-use library code from their TLS implementations where appropriate, restricts the ability for the DNP Cybersecurity Task Force and the DNP Technical Committee to extend on the syntax, and reduces the flexibility of the specification in the long term. (<i>Mea culpa</i>)\n",

    "\n",
    ": the `AssociationRequest` and `AssociationResponse` messages currently restrict the size of the certificate data to be transferred to $2^{16}-1$ octets. This limitation is likely too small for PQC cryptographic data to be transferred. I recommend increasing the data length field to three octets, which will limit the size of $2^{24}-1$ octets at the cost of one extra octet per message. Using four octets, and allowing $2^{32}-1$ octets of payload, may be overkill, though it may also be easier to implement for library writers.\n",

    "Add a one-octet `flags` field to the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message:\n",
    "\n",
    ": a `flag` field in the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` would allow the master to indicate that, while it did not receive PQC KEM data in the `AssociationResponse` message, it knows how to handle such data -- much like the “higher available“ flag in the `AssociationRequest` message. This would be a one-octet reserved byte near the start of the SPDU that, for now at least, can replace the previously proposed additional length field (the presence of which we can indicate by setting a bit in the flag field)<cite data-cite=\"landheer2023cstf\"></cite>.\n",

    ": in the `AssociationRequest` and `AssociationResponse` messages, thus proving ownership of the identity certificate's private keys. The Association handshake was based on the TLS handshake including its use of a signature over the handshake transcript to authenticate the handshake but, unlike TLS, it uses an HMAC over the transcript rather than a certificate-based signature. This means that if the ECDH public keys are not signed with the private key of the identity certificate, pownership of that private key is never proven. This is not an issue if the ECDH public key is either embedded in the identity certificate or is the same key, but it is an issue if detached or ephemeral ECDH keys are used -— something I think will be common. We should therefore require a signature on those keys<cite data-cite=\"landheer2023cstf2\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarify the specification w.r.t the `certificate data` fields:\n",
    "\n",

Define an extension syntax that the recipient can ignore if it can't parse it, so both parties can signal their capabilities while permitting fall-back."
