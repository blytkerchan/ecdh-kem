As it's an asymmetric cryptography algorithm, you need the other person's public key to do this but, unlike key exchange algorithms, the other person does not need your public key to receive the symmetric key and, unlike digital signature algorithms and key exchange algorithms, the recipient cannot authenticate the received key with only this mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually one of the oldest applications of RSA besides digital signatures: because RSA allows things encrypted with a public key to be  decrypted with the corresponding private key as well as allowing  something encrypted with a private key to be decrypted with the corresponding public key, it can be used both for key encapsulation and signatures."

We will exploit this fact in our simulation.\n",

In the case of a DH, this happens by Alice and Bob exchanging their respective public keys, and each using their respective private keys and each others' public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "While that use case is similar, there are significant differences: KEM does not provide mutual authentication where DH does, which means KEM requires the use of a separate digital signature algorithm: DH also requires the use of a signature algorithm, but only during public key exchanges while KEM requires it every time a new shared key is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to KEM, DH does not allow its user any influence over the contents of the symmetric key. Also, because with the use of the same keys the resulting shared secret is always the same, it is recommended to always include a salting step (generally in the form of a publicly-communicated salt and an HKDF function).

    "- shared secret generation: $X \\rightarrow sk \\rightarrow fpk \\rightarrow s$ where $sk$ is the local private key and $fpk$ is the foreign (remote) public key, and $s$ is the generated shared secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are only two functions, and the exchange function $X$ is symmetrical (in that $X~sk_a~pk_b = X~sk_b~pk_a$), generation of the shared secret can be done without any on-line communication, provided the foreign public key $fpk$ is known, and if the public key $pk$ is trusted by the recipient of a message, no further signatures are necessary. This means that if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and she wants to use a unique symmetric key to encrypt it (say using an AEAD), she only has to send the ciphertext of her message and the salt used to generate the symmetric key ($\\langle m', salt\\rangle$) to Bob. With KEM, the equivalent would be to generate a a shared secret and corresponding ciphertext, and send both the ciphertext and the salt along with the message to Bob, signing the entire message with a separate private key so Bob can verify the message, sending $\\langle m, ct, signature\\rangle$."

    "# Using a KEM in protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "Most protocols that use an DH-type algorithm today already also use a digital signature algorithm, if only to sign the DH public key exchanged between \"Alice\" and \"Bob\" (i.e. the client and the server). On this section, we will investigate how a KEM can be used to either augment or replace a DH in two related protocols in the OT space: TLS 1.3<cite data-cite=\"rescorla2018rfc\"></cite> and DNP3-SAv6 (not published yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a KEM in TLS 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "In TLS, the client will initiate the connection and request a session, the server will respond to that request with authenticating certificates and cryptographic materials, optionally requesting the client to authenticate itself as well. A mutual shared secret is established using an ECDH key exchange, and the transaction as a whole is authenticated<cite data-cite=\"rescorla2018rfc\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach to introducing a post-quantum KEM into this handshake is discussed in <cite data-cite=\"cryptoeprint:2019/858\">E. Crockett et al. \"Prototyping post-quantum and hybrid key exchange and authentication in TLS and SSH\", Cryptology ePrint Archive, Paper 2019/858, 2019.</cite> That paper provides a comprehensive overview of peevious work adding post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to protocols like TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, SSHv2, and IKEv2, as well as \"report(ing) on case studies exploring how two major Internet security protocols, Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Shell (SSH), can be adapted to use post-quantum cryptography, both for confidentiality (via post-quantum key exchange) and authentication (via post-quantum digital signatures)\"<cite data-cite=\"cryptoeprint:2019/858\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the more interesting findings of this paper are twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some of the experiments failed due to the sheer size of the public keys and cryptographic materials being used: two-byte size fields, which allow up 65,535 bytes of payload, were insufficient to accomodate some of the cryptographic materials being lugged around.\n",
    "2. TLS is extensible in that extensions are explicitly allowed on the `ClientHello` and `ServerHello` messages, and TLS 1.3 was designed with the goal of reducing the number of round trips needed to establish and authenticate a session, but that requires the client to send its KEM public key in the `ClientHello` message.\n",
    "3. A hybrid approach, mixing classical cryptography that can still be trusted (as long as $Q$-time has not expired) with PQC\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "See <cite data-cite=\"10.1007/978-3-319-76578-5_7\">F. Giacon et al. \"KEM Combiners\", Public-Key Cryptography -- PKC 2018, 2018</cite> for considerations for combining shared secrets from KEMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "For those protocols, the message from Bob to Alice sending Bob's public key does not really change: it needs to be signed by Bob and Alice needs to verify that signature, but they had to do that already. The main difference will be in the order of the handshake: if the handshake had Alice send her public key to Bob before Bob sent his public key to Alice, the protocol may need to become one where Bob ends up generating the shared secret first, and provides the ciphertext for the shared secret to Alice in his response. This is not the case in TLS, but it may be the case in the upcoming DNP3-SAv6.\n",
    "\n",
    "In DNP3-SAv6, the master station (a.k.a. controlling station in IEC 62351-5) sends its certificates, including its ECDH key, to the outstation (a.k.a. controlled station) in a message called the `AssociationRequest`. The outstation responds with its own certificate, including its ECDH key, in an `AssociationResponse`. Both sides then calculate the Encryption and Authentication Update Keys and prove to each other they have the same keys. Replacing this ECDH-based mechanism with a KEM-based mechanism would have the master send its certificates and KEM public key to the outstation in the `AssociationRequest` message, and have the outstation send its certificates and the $ct$ value in the `AssociationResponse` message. The outstation would then already have the Update Keys (which in DNP3-SAv6 are two 256-bit keys, so an HKDF to lengthen the key may be needed), and the master can decrypt it from the provided $ct$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the `AssociationRequest` message would only contain the master's certificates, the outstation would provide its certificates and a KEM public key in the `AssociationResponse` message, and the master would use the next message in the exchange to provide the ciphertext $ct$ as well as its proof of knowledge of the Update Keys. Upon receipt, the outstation would then decrypt the Update Keys, validate the proof of knowledge, and provide its own to the master.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of generating a KEM key pair, of generating the shared secret and ciphertext, and of decrypting the ciphertext is presently not well-known, so which of these approaches would work best for a protocol like DNP3-SAv6 or IEC 62351-5-derived protocols like IEC 60870-7-5 is hard to tell at this time. It is important to note, though, that it is possible to take either approach, remain compatible with what is currently in the specification in terms of bits-on-the-wire (i.e. the `AssociationRequest` and `AssociationResponse` messages have sufficient flexibility in their format to allow the transfer of a KEM public key and $ct$ value; though arguably the second proposed scheme is a bit harder to work into a DNP technical bulletin than the first one), and retain security in a post-quantum world."
