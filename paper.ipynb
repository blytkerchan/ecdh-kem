    "# What is a KEM?\n",
    "\n",
    "A KEM is used, as the name implies, to encapsulate a (symmetric) key in order to securely send it to someone else. As it's an asymmetric cryptography algorithm, you need the other person's public key to do this but, unlike key exchange algorithms, the other person does not need your public key to receive the symmetric key and, unlike digital signature algorithms and key exchange algorithms, the recipient cannot authenticate the received key with only a singge use of this mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually one of the oldest applications of RSA besides digital signatures: because RSA allows things encrypted with a public key to be decrypted with the corresponding private key as well as allowing  something encrypted with a private key to be decrypted with the corresponding public key, it can be used both for key encapsulation and signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three use-cases for KEM, all three discussed below. The first is a simple key encapsulation, where Alice sends a message to Bob, ascertaining only Bob can receive it, but Bob cannot authenticate the message as being from Alice, and without providing forward secrecy. The second is called \"Unilateral Authenticated Key Exchange\" or UAKE, where Alice sends a message to Bob, ascertaining only Bob can receive it, but Bob can still not authenticate the message as being from Alice; this time providing forward secrecy but requiring messages to be exchanged in both directions for the key exchange to occur. The third, called \"Authenticated Key Exchange\" or AKE, allows Alice and Bob to mutually authenticate and also provides forward secrecy, also requiring messages to be exchanged in both directions. This latter use-case is closest to the DH use-case, but unlike DH does not allow for an off-line mutually authenticated key exchange."

We will exploit this fact in our simulation.\n",

She does not have to receive any messages from Bob to do this (she already has his public key), and Bob does not need her public key.\n",
    "2. She can perform a \"Unilaterally Authenticated Key Exchange\" (UAKE), which allows her to send a message to Bob knowing only Bob can decrypt it, and provides limited forward secrecy. She does need to send a message to Bob and receive a response for this, in addition to the public key she already has. Bob does not need her public key.\n",

In the case of a DH, this happens by Alice and Bob exchanging their respective public keys, and each using their respective private keys and each others' public keys.\n",
    "\n",

To use only a KEM algorithm for a mutually authenticated key exchange, at least two messages need to be exchanged and the algorithm is used three times on either side (Alice encapsulates once and decapsulates twice; Bob encapsulates twice and decapsulates once).\n",

Also, because with the use of the same keys the resulting shared secret is always the same, it is recommended to always include a salting step (generally in the form of a publicly-communicated salt and an HKDF function).

This means that if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and she wants to use a unique symmetric key to encrypt it (say using an AEAD), she only has to send the ciphertext of her message and the salt used to generate the symmetric key $\\langle m', salt\\rangle$ to Bob.

    "3. Bob receives the salt and the encrypted message. He uses his own private key and Alice's public key to generate the shared secret, and uses Alice's salt to create the derived symmetric key. He can then use the derived symmetric key to decrypt and authenticate the message using the AEAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge for turning a DH into a KEM is to remove one of the exchanges from the protocol: we can only rely on Bob sending his public key to Alice, but Alice cannot send her public key to Bob before the shared key is generated.\n",

    "Formulating the problem like this, the solution is almost obvious. We can make it more so by redefining the KEM ciphertext as being \"such information as required by Bob to calculate, in combination with his own private key, the same shared key as Alice can calculate with Bob's public key\". It should now be obvious that the KEM ciphertext in the context of a DH algorithm is a tuple of Alice's public key, the salt, and any additional information pertinent parameters (such as the hash algorithm used or the number of rounds used in the HKDF)."

    "2. TLS is extensible in that extensions are explicitly allowed on the `ClientHello` and `ServerHello` messages, and TLS 1.3 was designed with the goal of reducing the number of round trips needed to establish and authenticate a session, but that requires the client to send its KEM public key in the `ClientHello` message. This puts a constraint on how PQC can be implemented in TLS without breaking backward comparibility.\n",

As the master is the party in the association that starts the association (potentially at the request of the outstation) it is equivalent, in TLS parlance, to the client. This is essentially equivalent to the client always dictating which ciphersuite shall be used for a given association, while the server can only either accept the dictate or refuse the association, according to system policy and local implementation.\n",

    "While this limits some of the flexibility of the protocol, it also resolves one of the design questions raised by <cite data-cite=\"cryptoeprint:2019/858\">E.

The outstation responds with its own certificate, including its ECDH public key, in an `AssociationResponse`. Both sides then calculate the Encryption and Authentication Update Keys and prove to each other that they have the same keys, using the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` and `UpdateKeyChangeResponse` messages.\n",

    "Once the Update Keys are established, only symmetric cryptography is used for authentication and encryption: MACs are used to prove ownership of the Update Keys and to authenticate the handshake transcript, AES is used in the keywrap algorithm (KWA) to establish session keys, and an AEAD is used for authenticated encryption during the sessions. All symmetric keys are at least 256 bitsin size, which even in light of Grover's algorithm<cite data-cite=\"grover1996fast\"></cite> is sufficient in this contect.

    "The first approach, which places key encapsulation on the outstation but gives the choice of the algorithm to use to the master, can be implemented without making any changes to the specified formats of any of the four messages in the handshake: both the `AssociationRequest` and the `AssociationResponse` message have a reserved space for certificate data for which the specification is flexible enough to allow for the addition of PQC cryptographic materials in the payload. As discussed below, this space may not be large enough to accomodate the change, which can be specified in a DNP Technical Bulletin after the standard's publication if needed. In this case, no new SPDU types and no changes in the SA version field value would be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the data field *is* currently under-specified: the format borrows from RFC 8446 and refers to section 4.4.2 of that specification, but that format is not sufficiently extensible for our purpose and does not allow explicitly signing the ECDH public key, which means ownership of each party's private keys may never be proven and which moves a possible failure due to tampering to the end of the handshake. (This may be a performance issue and, in some cases, a security issue, as was reported to the CSTF on July 28, 2023.) DNP3-SAv6 also calls for an optional use of an OCSP response for OCSP stapling, which is defined as an extension in TLS. The total size of the TLS construct can reach $2^{24}-1+2^8-1$ octets, which exceeds the $2^{16}-1$ octets allocated in DNP3-SAv6<cite data-cite=\"ieee1815.202x\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach would require the addition of an as-yet-to-be-defined object in the `AssociationRequest` for the master to indicate a KEM should be used. This is something that cannot currently be accomodated with the specified `AssociationRequest` syntax. It also requires the master to convey the KEM ciphertext to the outstation in the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message, which would be a change of format for that message. If this change were introduced after publication of the new standard incorporating SAv6, this would mean either the addition of a new SPDU (Security Protocol Data Unit) type or a change in SA version.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pre-publication version of this paper was discussed at the Wednesday, July 19, 2023 meeting of the DNP Cybersecurity Task Force (CSTF) where it was decided to add a field to the `UpdateKeyChangeRequest` message allowing the master to convey a KEM ciphertext to the outstation, thus allowing to switch the burden of calculating the ciphertext from the outstation to the master. Subsequent discusiion on the CSTF mailing list leaves the possibility for additional changes open, however."

    "### Size considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three size-related considerations that need to be taken into account when considering cryptography in the context of DNP3 and, more generally, OT, IoT, and IIoT systems: the amount of bits-on-the-wire data needed to transfer cryptographic data, the amount of on-device non-volatile memory needed to store cryptographic data, and the amount of run-time memory needed to process cryptographic data and cryptographic functions. M. Kumar's survey in <cite data-cite=\"kumar2022post\">\"Post-quantum cryptography Algorithm's standardization and performance analysis\"</cite> includes statistics on the maximum stack and heap usage on a representative device with a number of different algorithms, showing a wide range of values, only some of which are concerning in terms of memory usage in small devices. The choice of algorithms in an OT system can likely fairly easily avoid those more concerning algorithms in favor of less resource-hungry ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general guideline in the design of DNP3 cybersecurity is to limit the need for non-volatile storage aa much as possible, and to restrict the use of such storage to read-only use during normal operation except for the potential storage of the association's Update Keys, which are intended to be long-lived. The general idea being that a device only need to be able to present its \"birth certificate\", which may be self-signed and a counter-signed version of which may be provisioned to the master by the system's DNP Authority. Outside of that birth certificate, which can be generated at the device's first boot-up in factory, only 64 bytes of writable non-volatile storage are needed by DNP3-SAv6, as that is the size of the two Update Keys combined<cite data-cite=\"ieee1815.202x\"></cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important size consideration, then, is the a,ount of bits-on-the-wire bandwidth needed to set up an association. This will typically only happen once in the drvice's life-time and once the association is set up only symmetric cryptography is used for any session in that association. The asymmetric-cryptography-related cryptographic material that needs to be transferred consists of X.509 certificates, data needed for key exchange or key encapsulation, and digital aignatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this writing, the total size of both master and outstation certificate data is limited, in both the `AssociationRequest` and the `AssociationResponse` message, to 65,535 bytes. This precludes the use of some PQC algorithms, for which the size of a single public key can exceed 319 kiB and go up to 1.4 MiB for NTS-KEM using certain parameters, for example<cite data-cite=\"albrecht2019nts\"></cite>. This issue can be remediated by adding a third octet to the size fields in those two messages, an option that is currently under discussion with the DNP CSTF. Care will still need to be taken to make sure an association handshake does not interfere with the operational communication requirements of other devices on the same network <cite data-cite=\"tibodeau2023cstf\">(ref. [a comment to this effect on the CSTF mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/dnp3sav6/c/-YzYlZutBBM/m/T5hjM8d9AAAJ))</cite>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all PQC algorithms have such large size requirements, however,  but there does appear to be a trade-off between the bits-on-the-wire size of cryptographic material and the computational cost of the cryptographic functions to be executed,"

    "### Computational cost considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Manufacturing cost is always a significant factor when designing and developing OT, IoT, and IIoT devices, especially when those devices are intended to be high-volume and low-cost, and their ability for local processing and communications is seen as secondary-at-best to their primary function of protecting and automating critical infrastructure such as the power system. These considerations weigh heavily in many discussions around how cybersecurity is best designed into protocols such as DNP3. While recent development of ARM CPUs has meant concerns around processing power have become less of an issue for these systems, this \"free\" processing power has also lead to the use of Linux-based operating systems that are often not as optimized for domain-specific applications as had been the case for earlier generations of devices. Such optimization existed mostly out of necessity whereas, today, it represents a cost that can no longer be justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect of these types of systems, which is in part due to the way critical infrastructure development is financed in many countries. is that the devices that make up these systems are typically installed in the field and not replaced for a decade or more. This means that while it is possible to rely on firmware and software upgrades to improve security it is typically not possible to rely on improvements in hardware. Combining that with the fact that many of these devices have much of their computational resources already allocated to the device's primary function and that communications and cybersecurity are often treated as an after-thought the available resources for cyber-related computation can be extremely limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part due to these considerations, DNP3-SAv6 relies heavily on symmetric cryptography, for which hardware acceleration is ubiquitously available and which remains secure in the presence of adversaries with quantum computers. This again constrains the use of a PQC to the Association handshake and may partly drive the choice of both the algorithms to use and on which device (the master or the outstation) key encapsulation takes place. While M. Kumar's survey of post-quantum peformance in <cite data-cite=\"kumar2022post\">\"Post-quantum cryptography Algorithm's standardization and performance analysis\", Array 15, 2022</cite> shows, perhaps surprisingly (at least to me) encapsulating keys can be significantly less costly than decapsulating them, in which case it would make sense to perform encapsulating on the outstation, it may be too early to tell whether that will be true for all KEM standards, so it would be advisable to leave the door open to performing encapsulation on the master when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it should be noted that, as DNP3-SAv6 supports both mutual authentication and data encryption and, once the association is established, does not require asymmetric cryptography for subsequent sessions that nevertheless retain both mutual authentication and data encryption, the additional overhead a TLS connection would require for its sessions (which have their own asymmetric cryptography for every session) becomes unnecessary. I therefore see no reason to recommend using TLS in conjunction with DNP3, and in some cases would actually recommend against it, especially when communicating with resource-constrained devices that are part of critical infrastructure."

    "Cryptanalysis takes time. For the next decade or so, we will be in an inter-regnum of sorts before classical cryptography is no longer safe, but while post-quantum cryptographic standard algorithms have not yet been sufficiently analysed yet to know whether they are safe or not. Hopefully, there will be some overlap between the time safe post-quantum cryptographic standards are widely available, and the time quantum computers that can break classical cryptography are widely available. In the mean time, for some systems for which cybersecurity is sufficiently critical, it will make sense to use both classical and post-quantum cryptography, one in combination with the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where digital signatures are concerned, this means that any data that needs to be authenticated should be signed using both a classical algorithm like RSA<cite data-cite=\"rivest1978method\"></cite>, DSA<cite data-cite=\"pub2000digital\"></cite>, ECDSA<cite data-cite=\"johnson2001elliptic\"></cite>, or EdDSA<cite data-cite=\"josefsson2017edwards\"></cite>, and a post-quantum algorithm like CRYSTALS-Dilithium<cite data-cite=\"ducas2018crystals\"></cite>, Falcon<cite data-cite=\"prest2020falcon\"></cite>, or SPHINCS+<cite data-cite=\"bernstein2019sphincs+\"></cite>, and both signatures should be verified. Where key exchanges and key encapsulations are concerned, this means that the symmetric key used as a result of key negotiation should be a combination of the result of the classical and post-quantum algorithms used such that even if either one (but not both) of the keys is compromised, the key resulting from the combination is still secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly common practice to use a key derivation function for which all but one inputs are public, and use the derived key for encryption. In such a context, either one of the keys should therefore be consdiered public for the purpose of the choice of a key derivation function. Giacon <i>et al.</i> in <cite data-cite=\"10.1007/978-3-319-76578-5_7\">\"KEM Combiners\", in Public-Key Cryptography -- PKC 2018</cite> describe an efficient yet secure way of combining keys from different KEMs, which XORs the results of any number of standard pseudo-random functions (such as HKDF) that take the KEM ciphertext and output secret as inputs, in lieu of the salt an IKM. A similar approach can be used combining the output of a DH and a KEM, especially if the DH has been previously used to model a KEM, as shown in this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will, for some time, be systems in which either the master or the outstation will be capable of using PQC while the other station does not have that capability yet. This may require some new, optional extensions in some of the messages exchanged between master and outstation, which will for now be left to future discussion."

Using four octets, and allowing $2^{32}-1$ octets of payload, may be overkill, though it may also be easier to implement for library writers.\n",

This means that if the ECDH public keys are not signed with the private key of the identity certificate, pownership of that private key is never proven. This is not an issue if the ECDH public key is either embedded in the identity certificate or is the same key, but it is an issue if detached or ephemeral ECDH keys are used -— something I think will be common.

    "\n",
    "Using the lessons learned from other protocols, and leveraging current libraries to simulate a KEM using existing ECDH functions, it is possible to experiment with new constructs to validate some of the possible ways a KEM can be integrated with a novel protocol like DNP3-SAv6 while retaining its most important performance characteristics. These experiments should include tests in which hybrid scenarios are explored, such as scenarios where the master requests the use of ECDH in addition to a PQC KEM, scenarios where the outstation indicates it can use a PQC KEM even if the master hasn't requested it, scenarios where the master requests the use of PQC KEMs but a man in the middle attempts a downgrade attack (which needs to be overcome at least if classical cryptography is still available), etc. Solutions to such scenarios were discussed but do still need further development.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the proposed changes to the current standard prior to its publication, however, it should be possible to accomodate such changes as necessary using the normal amendmend procedures available in the DNP Technical Bulletins and subsequent revisions to the standard without having to change the DNP3-SA protocol version or breaking backward compatibility. Such technical bulletins should require post-quantum signatures to be verified when possible, and require that verification to pass (i.e. if the device *can* verify a post-quantum signature and one is presented, it shall do so and shall only accept validity if all available sigantures pass, even if equivalent classical signatures have already passed). The authenticated part of the message should also include an indicator to which signatures should be expected to be present, so a signature cannot simply be omitted from the message. This could be accomplished by indicating the use of a hybrid signature algorithm rather than using two disjoint signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A technical bulletin introducing a hybrid classical-and-PQC key negotiation should also specify how those algorithms are to be implemented, requiring the master and outstation to use both when available, but allowing a fall-back if either station is not capable of PQC. A mechanism to introduce the notion of optional extensions before standardization would be required for forward compatibility, as discussed. A new error code in the error SPDU may also be necessary to restart the handshake if the outstation requires PQC but the master doesn't offer it."
